**Bio:** I am currently a tenure-track faculty at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree in the department of computer science at [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/) advised by [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/) in 2022. I received my M.S. degree from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/) at University of Virginia and my B.S. degree in Mathematics at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in 2017 and 2015, respectively. I am also a member of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://ellis.eu/).


**Research Interests:** My research covers various topics in machine learning and security, including _trustworthy machine learning_, _statistical machine learning_, _convex/non-convex optimization_ and _deep learning_. Recently, I focus on understanding the misbehavior of machine learning models against different adversaries and designing robust systems for various machine learning applications. 

**Open Positions:** <span style="color:darkred"> I am looking for self-motivated students who are interested in trustworthy machine learning starting in 2024, including PhD students, research assistants, intern and visiting students. Check [Open Positions](position/) for more details.</span>
<!-- If you are interested in applying xfor a position, please send me an email with your CV and research interests. -->
