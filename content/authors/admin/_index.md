**Bio:** I am a faculty member at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en), where I lead the AIR-ML Lab. Prior to this, I earned my PhD in Computer Science at the [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), where I was advised by [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). I also hold an MS degree in Statistics from the University of Virginia and a BS degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). I am a member of the [European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems](https://ellis.eu/), affiliated with [ELLIS Unit Saarbr√ºcken](https://ellis.eu/units/saarbrucken).

**Research Interest:** My research spans a broad range of topics in machine learning (ML), with a primary focus on trustworthy AI, encompassing robustness, safety, privacy, bias, and interpretability. I'm also interested in deep learning theory, generative modeling, and optimization. Ultimately, my goal is to <font color ="#004F85">develop principled adversarial ML approaches to tackle the fundamental challenges in building reliable and trustworthy AI systems</font>. 

I am always looking for self-motivated students interested in machine learning research, including PhD students, HiWis, intern and visiting students. Check my [recent publications](https://xiao-zhang.net/#featured) and our lab website to learn more about the current focus and available positions.
