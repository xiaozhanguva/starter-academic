I am a tenure-track faculty at [CISPA Helmholtz Center for Information Security](https://cispa.de/en). I obtained my Ph.D degree in computer science at [University of Virginia](http://www.virginia.edu/), advised by [Prof. David Evans](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/). I received my M.S. degree from [Department of Statistics](https://statistics.as.virginia.edu/) at University of Virginia and my B.S. degree in Mathematics at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). My research interests cover a variety of topics in machine learning and security, including trustworthy machine learning, adversarial machine learning, statistical machine learning, convex/non-convex optimization and deep learning. Here is my latest [CV](https://xiao-zhang.net/uploads/resume.pdf).
